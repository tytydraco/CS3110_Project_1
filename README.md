# CS3110_Project_1 and 2
Calculator project for Formal Languages and Automata

# Features
- Written in Kotlin, which runs in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- Accepts positive and negative floating point numbers
- Accepts scientific notation format (i.e. 2.1e4)
- Accepts arithmetic (such as +, -, *, /, and parentheses)

# Project requirements
- Project 1 is fully a DFA (`parseDouble`)
- Project 2 is a PDA (`evaluateExpression`) using recursion instead of a stack. Portions are evaluated, and then the method is called again with the new information. There are a few helper methods are just regular functions to perform basic string operations.

# Usage
Run program and enter floats or arithmetic, and hit enter to process. When finished, terminate program.
